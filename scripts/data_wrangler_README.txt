I'm sure you have either already noticed or will notice the spaghetti code that is my data wrangler.
You will have already or will notice that there are no comments explaining what it does.
To be honest, this was the first tool I developed for myself and I never intended on sharing the code with anyone.
I know the functions are all over the place and not organized very well.
This script originally started as a series of commands that I later turned into functions.
I wanted to write this and explain myself before you dive into the code wonder why I never bothered with comments and why it's so disorganized.
So I'm going to take this opportunity to apologize.
If you read this - thank you. If you have any feedback or suggestions - please let me know.
I greatly appreciate your time.
